# Using nano

In many Linux implementation, we have a much easier to use editor called nano. This is controlled by a range of hotkeys, the most important of which are shown at the bottom of the screen. The ^ symbol denotes the use of the control character, so \[^X] means holding \[ctrl] whilst pressing \[X] causes nano to exit.

The top line displays the version of nano in the left corner and the name of the file being edited, as well as its status.

The third line from the bottom indicates the status of the file you are editing, if it has a file name. The bottom line shows the most common commands and \[ctrl] \[g] will get you help. You only really need to be able to use only two commands; \[ctrl]\[O] to write a file and \[ctrl]\[X] to exit.
