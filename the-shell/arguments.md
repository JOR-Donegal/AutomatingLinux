# Arguments

We can pass parameters to commands by using arguments. Commands typed at the prompt have a standard layout, in the form;

command \[arg1] \[arg2].....\[ar&#x67;_&#x6E;_]

The command is any valid Linux command, the arguments (however many are expected) are separated by a space. Some commands do not allow for arguments, for other commands, arguments can be mandatory or optional.

For example:

**cp myfile.txt myfile.bak**

is a single command with two arguments, separated by spaces.

When we try to identify arguments, they are numbered sequentially from left to right, starting with the command itself which is argument zero.

In the command cp **myfile.txt myfile.bak**

Argument 0 = cp

Argument 1 = myfile.txt

Argument 2 = myfile.bak
