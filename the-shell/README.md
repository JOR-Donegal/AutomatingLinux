# The Shell

When you open a terminal in Linux, you are running a programme known as a shell. The shell is a command interpreter; it takes the commands you type in, parses them to figure out what they are and what you want to do, and then executes the command. As a working definition of a shell, consider it to be a program that is used to type commands.

There are several shells available for Linux;

* The Bourne Shell (sh)
* The C Shell (csh)
* The Bourne-Again Shell (bash)
* The Z Shell (zsh)
* The Korn Shell (ksh)
* Debian Almquist shell (dash)

In our exercises, we are using the default shell only (bash), which is an enhanced version of the Bourne Shell, written as part of the GNU project. Apart from acting as a command interpreter, we can write a text file with a sequence of commands; this is a script file.

A Script file is an executable file, essentially a programme written at the command prompt. It is similar in many ways to a batch file in MS DOS. Apart from commands, it may contain additional details like conditional logic.

In this section we will examine how to do this, including the syntax for programme flow control, decision etc. Just like a normal interpreted programming language!
