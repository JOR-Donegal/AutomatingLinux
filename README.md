# Background

In the previous section, you have learned how to basically navigate around UNIX or Linux. In this section, we will figure out how to programme the Linux command shell, how to write scripts.

Some of the scripts I have date back to the 1980s and even to me, that seems bizarre! But UNIX has been around a long time and although much has changed in Linux, scripting pretty much works the same.&#x20;

Just a warning...these notes are based on a course I wrote in 2010 and have refreshed over the years. In some examples, I was using CentOS v7 (c.2014). All this code should work, but as in all cases in computing, the only thing you can be certain of is uncertainty!&#x20;

At time of writing (August 2025), I am only using Ubuntu 24.04LTS and some Raspbian.
